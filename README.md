# MinecraftBadAutoMiner
A very very very unusable minecraft autominer. 

But in the case you do want to use it: 

Position yourself facing a 3x3 grid mining tunnel and stand a block away from your mining block. The mining block should be the middle of the 3x3. 

Run the program and press r to begin it. Press s for 3-4 seconds to stop. 

I hope this doesn't break your computer. Many Thanks.
